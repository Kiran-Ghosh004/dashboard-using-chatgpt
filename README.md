🧠 What You’ll Learn
Convert your raw data to JSON
Prompt engineering techniques to get exactly what you want from ChatGPT
Build a fully functional dashboard from scratch
Style it with glassmorphism and a modern UI

🔧 Prerequisites
ChatGPT (GPT-4 or equivalent) or gemini ai
A CSV file with your sales data
Basic understanding of HTML/JS (not mandatory but helps)


📋 Step-by-Step Guide

1️⃣ Convert Your Sales Data
Convert your .xlsx or any other format to CSV first.
Use any online CSV to JSON converter to get your JSON data.
Copy a single sample entry from the JSON array.

2️⃣ Prompt Engineering 🧙‍♂️
👉 Prompt 1
****This is the structure of my sales data in JSON format. Understand the structure and suggest five key data visualization metrics that would be the best fit to create an interactive sales dashboard. Also explain why we should use each one?****
💡 Use this to brainstorm the perfect dashboard layout tailored to your data.

👉 Prompt 2
****Now, I want you to create an interactive sales performance dashboard with the five key visualizations using HTML and JavaScript. Use the latest version of Plotly.js CDN and include an upload feature so that we can upload the JSON file. It should generate the dashboard based on the uploaded data.
Note: I need to upload the sales data from my local computer, and it should create the dashboard based on that data.****
💻 ChatGPT will generate a fully working dashboard code. You can copy and run it directly in your browser or use next prompt for more simplicty lmao. 

👉 Prompt 3
****Provide this as an HTML downloadable file.****
 Now you get a neat .html file. Open it and upload your JSON sales data from your device.

 👉 Prompt 4 (Optional but 🔥)
**** From the dashboard you created, change the style to glass morphism. Then, adjust the padding width of the charts to 40%, and change the background colour to icy blue. Can you also provide this as a downloadable HTML file?****
🎨 This final touch gives your dashboard modern vibes and extra sauce.



⏱️ Results in 8–10 Minutes
